            <p>My name is Harwinddranath Muralitheran and this is my mini-biography. I am currently in my final year of my undergraduate degree at UWA, having moved to Perth from Malaysia in 2013. I  initially enrolled in the Computer Science and  Software Engineering majors but after a change of heart, I switched to the Data Science major in my second year of study. I am particularly intrigued by the advances in data analysis and visualisation, along with the use of statistics. Outside of the academic world, I am extremely passionate football  fan and regularly stay up during the night (along with my dad) to watch our favourite team, Liverpool FC. Having followed the sport for over 15 years, I think I am right in  considering myself a decent footballer, having captained my school teams in Malaysia and in Perth. Over the last couple of years, data analysis has become an integral part of football, with numerous teams employing data analysts to study advanced metrics such as xG (Expected Goals), xA (expected assists), and possession statistics with the aim of improving their styles and sequences of play. With the hope of graduating in the coming months, it is my dream to one day, be involved in the sports analytics field and work with some of the biggest names in the game.</p>
